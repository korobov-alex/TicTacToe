# Tic-Tac-Toe Java Game

This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. The game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other to achieve a winning condition by forming a line of their respective symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal on the game board.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns entering their moves by selecting a row and column.
3. The game continues until one player achieves a winning condition or the board is filled with no winner.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-java.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tic-tac-toe-java
   ```

3. Compile the Java files:

   ```bash
   javac MyProgram.java
   ```

4. Run the game:

   ```bash
   java MyProgram
   ```

## Gameplay Instructions

1. Enter the row and column numbers to make a move.
2. The game will display the current state of the board after each move.
3. The first player to form a line of their symbols (X or O) wins the game.
